This is a project made to learn and test new technologies in this case Ionic 4.

To run this project make sure you have node and ionic cli because the project is on development and it's not deployed yet.

* Donwload the project
* npm install -g ionic@latest
* npm i
* ionic serve --lab -o

The version that I am working on it's mobile so you will not see a good design on desktop.

The features that aren't on the porject but I want to add are:

**Technicals**
